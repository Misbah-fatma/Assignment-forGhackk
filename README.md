Internship Assignment Completion Summary

I successfully developed a Webtoon Library App for Animemangatoon.com, incorporating the following features:

Home Page: Displayed a list of popular webtoons, complete with titles, thumbnail images, and brief descriptions.
Webtoon Detail Page: Created a detailed page for each webtoon, featuring an enlarged image, comprehensive description, and a user comments section. Data was dynamically fetched via a RESTful API.
User Authentication: Implemented a simple login and registration system using JWT, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access exclusive features like adding webtoons to favorites.
Favorites Page: Developed a page for logged-in users to view their favorite webtoons, with favorites stored dynamically in a MongoDB/MySQL database.
Deployment: Deployed the application on Heroku, ensuring it is secure and that environment variables are managed properly.
The project was uploaded to GitHub and shared as per the assignment submission guidelines.
